# Public Health ML Analysis

This project presents an end-to-end machine learning analysis to identify:

- Individuals likely to need **social support**
- Individuals at **high mental health risk**

## Key Highlights
- ~70% of individuals identified as socially and mentally vulnerable
- Logistic Regression used for interpretability and policy relevance
- Clear visualizations: confusion matrices, ROC curves, pie charts
- Practical policy recommendations included

## Tools & Techniques
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Model evaluation and visualization

## Use Case
This work demonstrates how machine learning can support **public health screening and decision-making**.
